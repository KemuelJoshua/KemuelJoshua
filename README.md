Hey there! I’m @Kim, your friendly neighborhood code ninja.
I’m constantly on the lookout for ways to break and then beautifully fix things with code.
By day, I’m crafting elegant software solutions as a developer, turning coffee into code like it’s a superpower. Coffee isn’t just a drink—it’s the fuel that powers my coding magic.
